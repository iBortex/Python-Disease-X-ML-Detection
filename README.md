# Python-Disease-X-ML-Detection

Disease X Detection:

Certain physiological features are given in a numerical form, along with
the diagnosis of individuals as being infected (class 1) or not (class 0).
Number of Samples: ~110,000
Number of Predictors: 90


Deliverable:

1. A report must include the following sections (no more than 4 pages in total):
a. Project description (details of the given data set, objective of the project, etc.)
b. Data visualization (descriptive analysis of data mostly consisting of visuals/plots)
c. Data pre-processing and data splitting techniques (provide proper justification/explanation
for each technique utilized in your project)
d. Description of the model(s) used for analysis and provide justification for the following:
a. model selection
b. resampling method(s) utilized during training
c. performance metric used to gauge the prediction accuracy of the model
e. Visual representation of results: confusion matrix, ROC curve, accuracy and other plots
f. Conclusion: thoughts about why the selected model produces such results


2. Obtain the best model on the training data set and then apply that model on the test data set.
a. Report the predicted (y_hat) values for the samples in the test data set in a csv format.
3. A working code should be in python notebook format and satisfy the following criteria:
a. The code should run without any modification from the instructor.
b. The code should include comments describing each of the steps.
